[[release-notes-5.1.0-M2-overall-improvements]]
=== Overall Improvements

* In 5.0.1, all artifacts were changed to have an _optional_ instead of a mandatory
  dependency on the _@API Guardian_ JAR in their published Maven POMs. However, although
  the Java compiler should ignore missing annotation types, a lot of users have reported
  that compiling tests without having the _@API Guardian_ JAR on the classpath results in
  warnings emitted by `javac` that look like this:
+
----
warning: unknown enum constant Status.STABLE
reason: class file for org.apiguardian.api.API$Status not found
----
+
To avoid confusion, the JUnit team has decided to make the dependency to the
_@API Guardian_ JAR _mandatory_ again.


[[release-notes-5.1.0-M2-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

==== Bug Fixes

* Test methods selected by _fully qualified method name_ via
  `DiscoverySelectors.selectMethod(String)`, via the `method` or `methods` element of the
  `selectors` configuration for the `junitPlatform` Gradle plugin, or via the
  `-select-method` or `-m` command-line options for the `ConsoleLauncher` can now contain
  special characters -- for example, for JVM languages such as Kotlin and Groovy.
* Summary table is no longer printed via the `ConsoleLauncher` and Gradle plugin when
  details mode `NONE` is selected, unless there are errors.
* The current module layer is now used when scanning for test classes within modules. The
  current module layer is the one that the class loader for the `ModuleUtils` class
  returns. If the current layer cannot be obtained, the algorithm falls back to the boot
  layer.
* The XML report produced by the `ConsoleLauncher` and Gradle plugin is no longer invalid
  when the exception message of a failed test contains the XML CDATA end marker `]]>`.
* The `ConsoleLauncher`, the Gradle plugin, and the Maven Surefire provider now attempt to
  write a valid class name into the `classname` attribute of `<testcase/>` elements in the
  XML reports. In addition, the `name` attribute of dynamic tests and test template
  invocations (such as repeated and parameterized tests) is now suffixed with the index of
  the invocation so they are distinguishable by reporting tools.
* The Maven Surefire provider now includes the method parameter types when writing the
  `name` attribute of `<testcase/>` elements into XML reports. However, due to a
  limitation of Maven Surefire, instead of `methodName(Type)` they are written as
  `methodName{Type}`.

==== New Features and Improvements

* New `SUMMARY` details mode for the `ConsoleLauncher` and Gradle plugin which prints
  the table of success and failure counts at the end of test plan execution. This new
  mode is analogous to the previous behavior of the `NONE` details mode.
* The summary table of a console launcher run now contains the initial ten stack trace
  lines to better describe the location of the failure.
* Non-inherited _composed annotations_ which are meta-annotated with a given `@Inherited`
  annotation are now considered to be implicitly _inherited_ when searching for the given
  meta-annotation within a class hierarchy.
* The Maven Surefire provider now supports the `test` parameter that tells Surefire to
  only execute a subset of test classes or methods, e.g. by specifying `-Dtest=...` on the
  command line (see the
  http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/test-mojo.html#test[Surefire documentation]
  for details).
* Tests can now be included or excluded based on their tags using a
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#running-tests-tag-expressions, tag expression language>> when
  executed using the `Launcher`, `ConsoleLauncher`, Gradle plugin, or Maven Surefire
  provider.


[[release-notes-5.1.0-M2-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Bug Fixes

* Test classes selected via one of the `selectClass()` variants in `DiscoverySelectors`,
  via the `aClass` or `classes` element of the `selectors` configuration for the
  `junitPlatform` Gradle plugin, or via the `-select-class` or `-c` command-line options
  for the `ConsoleLauncher` are no longer allowed to be `private`. This aligns with the
  behavior for test classes discovered via package, class path, and module path scanning.

==== New Features and Improvements

* Developers can now register extensions _programmatically_ by annotating fields in test
  classes with `{RegisterExtension}`.
** See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#extensions-registration-programmatic, Programmatic
   Extension Registration>> in the User Guide for details.
* New `@EnabledIf` annotation that is used to control whether the annotated test class or
  test method is _enabled_ or _disabled_ by evaluating a script from a dynamic scripting
  language such as JavaScript or Groovy.
** See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-conditional, Conditional Test Execution>>
   in the User Guide for details.
* `@ValueSource` now additionally supports literal values of type `short`, `byte`,
  `float`, `char`, and `java.lang.Class` for parameterized tests.
* New support for parameterized tests for implicit conversion from a `String` to an
  argument of any of the following common Java types. See the
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-argument-conversion-implicit-table,
  implicit conversion table>> in the User Guide for examples.
** `java.io.File`
** `java.math.BigDecimal`
** `java.math.BigInteger`
** `java.net.URI`
** `java.net.URL`
** `java.nio.charset.Charset`
** `java.nio.file.Path`
** `java.util.Currency`
** `java.util.Locale`
** `java.util.UUID`
* New fallback mechanism for parameterized tests for implicit conversion from a `String`
  to an argument of a given target type if the target type declares exactly one suitable
  _factory method_ or a _factory constructor_.
** See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-argument-conversion-implicit-fallback,
   Fallback String-to-Object Conversion>> in the User Guide for details.
* Due to a change in the JUnit Platform's `AnnotationUtils` class, non-inherited
  _composed annotations_ which are meta-annotated with a given `@Inherited` annotation
  are now considered to be implicitly _inherited_ when searching for the given
  meta-annotation within a class hierarchy.
** For example, an `@Inherited` annotation such as `@TestInstance` will now be discovered
   on a custom _composed annotation_ declared on a superclass even if the _composed
   annotation_ is not declared as `@Inherited`.
* Extensions for JUnit Jupiter can now access JUnit Platform configuration parameters at
  runtime via the new `getConfigurationParameter(String key)` method in the
  `ExtensionContext` API.
* Extensions for JUnit Jupiter can now access the `Lifecycle` of the current test
  instance via the new `getTestInstanceLifecycle()` method in the `ExtensionContext` API.
* New callback interface `CloseableResource` introduced in `ExtensionContext.Store`. A
  `Store` is bound to the lifecycle of its extension context. When the lifecycle of an
  extension context ends, the associated store is closed, and each stored value that is
  an instance of `ExtensionContext.Store.CloseableResource` is notified by an invocation
  of its `close()` method.
* Selected dynamic tests and test template invocations can now be executed separately
  without running the complete test factory or test template. This allows to rerun single
  or selected parameterized, repeated or dynamic tests by selecting their unique IDs in
  subsequent discovery requests.
* New Kotlin-friendly `fail` methods added as _top-level functions_ in the
  `org.junit.jupiter.api` package.
** When calling the `Assertions.fail` methods from Kotlin, the compiler required the
   generic return type of `fail` to be declared explicitly when calling it -- for
   example, `fail<Nothing>("Some message")`. These new top-level functions remove this
   requirement by returning
   https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-nothing.html[`Nothing`].


[[release-notes-5.1.0-M2-junit-vintage]]
=== JUnit Vintage

==== Bug Fixes

* When using a tag filter to include/exclude a tag that represents a JUnit 4 category,
  e.g. `"com.example.Integration"`, the Vintage Engine no longer mistakenly executes all
  test methods of test classes that contain at least one included test method, e.g. one
  that is annotated with `@Category(com.example.Integration.class)`, regardless whether
  they belong to the same category.
