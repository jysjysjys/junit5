[[release-notes-6.0.0-M2-junit-platform-deprecations-and-breaking-changes]]
==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* Discontinue `junit-platform-suite-commons` which is now integrated into
  `junit-platform-suite`.

  `Launcher.execute(LauncherDiscoveryRequest, TestExecutionListener[])` in favor of

[[release-notes-6.0.0-M2-junit-platform-new-features-and-improvements]]
==== New Features and Improvements

* Introduce new `Launcher.execute({LauncherExecutionRequest})` API with corresponding
  `LauncherExecutionRequestBuilder` to enable the addition of parameters to test
  executions without additional overloads of `execute`.
* Introduce `LauncherDiscoveryRequestBuilder.forExecution()` method as a convenience
  method for constructing a `{LauncherExecutionRequest}` that contains a
  `{LauncherDiscoveryRequest}`.
* Introduce support for cancelling a running test execution via a `{CancellationToken}`
  passed to the `{Launcher}` as part of a `{LauncherExecutionRequest}` and from there to
  all registered test engines. Please refer to the
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#launcher-api-launcher-cancellation, User Guide>> for details
  and a usage example.
* Passing the `--fail-fast` option to the `execute` subcommand of the `ConsoleLauncher`
  now causes test execution to be cancelled after the first failed test.
* Provide cancellation support for implementations of `{HierarchicalTestEngine}` such as
  JUnit Jupiter, Spock, and Cucumber.
* Provide cancellation support for the Suite and Vintage test engines
* Introduce `TestTask.getTestDescriptor()` method for use in
  `HierarchicalTestExecutorService` implementations.
