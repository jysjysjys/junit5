[[release-notes-5.3.0-RC1-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

==== Bug Fixes

* ❓

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* A `ClasspathResourceSource` can now be created from a `URI` via the new `from(URI)`
  static factory method if the `URI` uses the `classpath` scheme.


[[release-notes-5.3.0-RC1-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Bug Fixes

* ❓

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* Generation of a detailed failure message for a failed assertion no longer fails if the
  `toString()` implementation of an object supplied to the assertion throws an exception.
  Instead, the object with the broken `toString()` implementation will be referenced via
  a default String representation based on the object's fully qualified class name and
  system hash code, separated by an `@` symbol.
* Although it is _highly discouraged_, it is now possible to extend the `{Assertions}`
  and `{Assumptions}` classes for special use cases.
* A custom test source `URI` for a dynamic container or dynamic test will now be
  registered as a `ClasspathResourceSource` if the `URI` uses the `classpath` scheme.
* New `TestInstanceFactory` extension API that enables custom creation of test class
  instances.
  - See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#extensions-test-instance-factories, Test Instance
    Factories>> in the User Guide for details.
* `ArgumentConverters` and `ArgumentsAggregators` registered using `@ConvertWith` and
  `@AggregateWith`, respectively, are now only instantiated once per `@ParameterizedTest`
  instead of once for each invocation.
* Performance improvements for executing parameterized tests, particularly when the method
  declares more than a few parameters.
* Generation of the display name for a `@ParameterizedTest` no longer fails if the
  `toString()` implementation of an argument for the parameterized test throws an
  exception. Instead, the object with the broken `toString()` implementation will be
  referenced via a default String representation based on the object's fully qualified
  class name and system hash code, separated by an `@` symbol.


[[release-notes-5.3.0-RC1-junit-vintage]]
=== JUnit Vintage

==== Bug Fixes

* ❓

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* The `VintageTestEngine` now uses the _simple name_ of a test class as the display
  name instead of the _fully qualified class name_. This aligns with the behavior of the
  `JupiterTestEngine`.
