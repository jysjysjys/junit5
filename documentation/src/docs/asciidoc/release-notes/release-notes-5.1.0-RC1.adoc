No changes.


[[release-notes-5.1.0-RC1-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* The `@EnabledIf` annotation introduced in 5.1 M2 has been moved to the
  `org.junit.jupiter.api.condition` package.

==== New Features and Improvements

* The `value` attribute of `@MethodSource` is no longer mandatory. If no value (or an
  empty String) is supplied as a method name, a method with the same name as the current
  `@ParameterizedTest` method will be used as the factory method by convention.
** See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-sources-MethodSource,
   @MethodSource>> in the User Guide for details.
* New predefined `@Enabled*` and `@Disabled*` annotations for declarative _conditional
  test execution_. See the following sections of the User Guide for details.
** <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-conditional-execution-os, Operating Systems>>
** <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-conditional-execution-jre, Java Runtime
   Environment Versions>>
** <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-conditional-execution-system-properties,
   System Properties>>
** <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-conditional-execution-environment-variables,
   Environment Variables>>
* New `@DisabledIf` annotation that is used to control whether the annotated test class or
  test method is _enabled_ or _disabled_. It inverts the logic applied by `@EnabledIf`.
** See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-conditional-execution-scripts,
   Script-based Conditions>> in the User Guide for details.


[[release-notes-5.1.0-RC1-junit-vintage]]
=== JUnit Vintage

==== New Features and Improvements

* Prior to this release, the Vintage test engine only returned a childless
  `TestDescriptor` for test classes annotated with `@Ignore`. However, build tools like
  Gradle need to show an accurate number of tests, i.e. they want to access and count the
  test methods of a test class regardless whether it's ignored.
  The Jupiter engine already discovers skipped containers, e.g. test classes annotated
  with `@Disabled`, including their children and descendants. The Vintage engine now
  adopts this approach and returns a full subtree of `TestDescriptors` for classes
  annotated with `@Ignore`. During execution, it will only report the `TestDescriptor`
  of the test class as skipped which is consistent with how the Jupiter engine reports
  skipped containers.
