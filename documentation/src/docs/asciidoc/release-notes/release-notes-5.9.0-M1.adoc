[[release-notes-5.9.0-M1-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

==== Bug Fixes

* ❓

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* `ConfigurationParameters.size()` has been deprecated in favor of the new `keySet()`
  method.

==== New Features and Improvements

* `ConfigurationParameters` has a new `keySet()` method which allows you to retrieve all
  configuration parameter keys.
* New `IterationSelector` for selecting a subset of a test's or container's iterations.
* JUnit OSGi bundles now contain `engine` and `launcher` requirements ensuring that at
  resolution time a fully running set of dependencies is calculated, avoiding the need for
  these to be manually specified.

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* `@TempDir` now includes a cleanup mode attribute for preventing a temporary directory

  configuration parameter.
* Support for FreeBSD and OpenBSD operating systems in `@EnabledOnOs` and `@DisabledOnOs`.
* New `MATCH_NONE` mode for `@EnumSource` that selects only those enum constants whose
  names match none of the supplied patterns.
* New `TestInstancePreConstructCallback` extension API that is called prior to test
  instance construction – symmetric to the existing `TestInstancePreDestroyCallback`
  extension API.
* Extensions can now leverage registered `ParameterResolvers` when invoking methods and
  constructors via the new `ExecutableInvoker` available in the `ExtensionContext`.
* A subset of the invocations of parameterized or dynamic tests can now be selected via
  the new `IterationSelector` discovery selector when launching the JUnit Platform.
