==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* `assertThrows` for Kotlin can now be used with suspending functions and other lambda
  contexts that require inlining.
* Synthetic constructors are now ignored when instantiating a test class.
* The Javadoc for the `provideTestTemplateInvocationContexts()` method in
  `TestTemplateInvocationContextProvider` has been aligned with the actual implementation.
  Providers are now officially allowed to return an empty stream, and the error message
  when all provided streams are empty is now more helpful.
* The `JRE` enum now provides a static `currentVersion()` method that returns the enum
  constant for the currently executing JRE, e.g. for use in custom execution conditions
  and other extensions.
* The `name` attribute of `@ParameterizedTest` is now clearly documented to be a
  `MessageFormat` pattern.
* New `DisplayNameGenerator` named `Simple` (based on `Standard`) that removes trailing
  parentheses for methods with no parameters.
* New `MethodOrderer` named `DisplayName` that sorts test methods alphanumerically based
  on their display names.
* New `getDisplayName()` method in `MethodDescriptor`.

* The internal `JUnit4VersionCheck` class -- which verifies that a supported version of
